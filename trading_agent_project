Idea:

3 main components
Algorithms checking to see if buy/sell
Web scraper to gather news + social media posts, assess general market sentiment + news
LLM to see buy/sell signals AND sentiment
  Basically use the LLM and historical data to see if a real signal, or fake signal

Issue is the dataset. I think to start off with, just use the bot to gather general market sentiment.


Ways to speed it up:
Use multi-threading; send request, start another thread. Send request to LLM, while LLM is processing, send another request via a different thread. Etc.
